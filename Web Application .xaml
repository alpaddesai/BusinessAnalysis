Factors affecting test plans include development schedules, resource availability, company finances, market pressures, quality risks, budget and product cost. The test documentation requires a systematic analysis of the web system under test.   Example : A sample application uses an active server page (ASP) technology. Web servers process ASP scripts based on user request before transferring the pages to the  user.  ASP scripts are similar to server side scripts in that they include common gateway interface (CGI) scripts and run on the Web server versus the client side. Database activities are supported by MS SQL and a single Java applet runs on the client browser to display defect metrics. "/>

By compiling this intermediate language, to binaries that is specific for a given type of computer, the single Java program can be run on several different computer platforms for which there is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), once a Java program has been compiled into bytecode it is placed on the web server. The Web server delivers bytecode to Web browsers which interpret and run the code. Java programs that are designed to run inside of programs are called applets.  However Java applets cannot make application or system function calls. Active X enabled browsers similar to Jave applets supports the execution of event based objects within a browser."/>
